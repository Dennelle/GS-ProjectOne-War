   - Clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Dennelle/GS-ProjectOne-War
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

## Objective

The objective of the game is to maintain your peace by drawing a higher card than the 2nd player. If you match ranks with the other player, a War scenario is triggered. In a War scenario, both players lose 4 points (not cards). The player with the most points after all the cards are played wins. Peace is designed to be more efficient than the original War game and promotes awareness of one's vibration.

## Features

- ☐ **Feature 1:** Cards are automatically shuffled.
- ☐ **Feature 2:** Scores are added and subtracted.
- ☐ **Feature 3:** Plays music on click.
- ☐ **Feature 4:** Screen changes when War is on.
- ☐ **Feature 5:** CSS keyframe.

## Next Steps

The next iteration of Peace includes:

- ☐ Replacing cards with gemstones that have power levels. If your gemstone matches another player's gemstone, you have to answer a trivia question to win all the points.
- ☐ Adding a 3 or 4-second timer between card plays.
