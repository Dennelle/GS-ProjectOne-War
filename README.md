# GS-ProjectOne-War

Peace by Dennelle is based on the classic War Game with a positive twist. 

The object of the game is to keep your peace by drawing a higher card than the 2nd player. If you match ranks with other players then you enter a War scenario. In a War scenario both players lose 4 points. The player with the most points after the cards run out wins.
