    <p>~ How To Play~</p>
    <p>Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher number card means they have a higher vibration and takes both cards to earn two points. If the cards are the same rank, you have entered a WAR and both players lose 4 points. The object of the game is to maintain your peace by having a higher vibration than your opponent. War indicates you a vibrating at a low frequency and fighting with another.</p>
        <p><em>Can you keep the peace?</em></p>
